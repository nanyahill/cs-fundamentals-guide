 # [Counting Sort](https://github.com/nanyahill/coding-interview-resources/blob/master/src/algorithms/sorting/countingsort/CountingSort.java)
  #### Key Ideas:
  	- Works only on an integer-based array within a GIVEN range. (Range must be given!)
	- Elements of the input array map to the index of a temporary array (aka count array).
	- Each index of the count array stores the count of that index, that is, the frequency
	  which the index appears as a value in the input.
	- A prefix-sum (running sum) is performed for elements in the count array to determine the starting position/place
	  of the element in the sorted array. For example, count[i] = 3 means  For example, count[i] = 3 means that the
	  last value of i would appear in position 3 of the sorted array.
	- Overall there are three arrays- the input array of size n, the count array of size k, and
	  the sorted array of size n.

  #### Properties/Sidenotes:
  	- The size of the count array should be >= max(input[]), for example, if the maximum value of the 
	  input value is 9, size of the count array should 10 (due to zero-based array-indexing).
	- The algorithm is efficient/practical ONLY if the range of values (max - min) is significantly less than n 
	  (the number of elements) or the range is fixed (e.eg ASCII characters).
	- In this algorithm, input values are used as index, hence not suitable for sorting floating point numbers.
	- The algorithm can be extended to include negative integers.
	- It is a stable sorting algorithm. This is useful in Radix sort.
	- It is NOT an in-place sorting algorithm when used with aux storage. Hence, useful if additional memory is a no issue. However, it can be trade stability for in-place movement of elements to their final position.

  #### Usage:
  	- The list is made up of integers or can be mapped to integers
	- The range of elements is known
	- Most of the elements in the range are present
	- The additional memory usage is not an issue

  #### Time and Space Complexity:
Worst Case Time | Best Case Time| Average Case Time | Space |
-------- | --- | --- | --- |
O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(n + k) due to the output array and the count array
