#### Key Ideas:
          - Array is divied into two parts- LHS is sorted subarray and RHS is unsorted subarray
          - Initially, unsorted suabarray is empty while the sorted subarray is the whole array 
          - Select the ith smallest element and swap it with the element at the ith position.
	      - This way the ith smallest element is inserted in the correct position.

#### Properties/Sidenotes:
          - It is a comparison based sorting algorithm
	      - It is not stable algorithm
	      - It is an in-place algorithm.

#### Algorithm Analysis:
        - Time: **Best Case:** O(n^2), **Average/Worst Case:** O(n^2)
        - Space: **Best Case:** O(1), **Average/Worst Case:** O(1)
